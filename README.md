# forecasting-airline-delays
Predict departure delay/no delay, where a delay is defined as 15-minute delay (or greater) with respect to the planned time of departure. This prediction should be done two hours ahead of departure (thereby giving airlines and airports time to regroup and passengers a heads up on a delay).
